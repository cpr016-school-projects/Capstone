# Capstone - Object Oriented Design and Programming - COS 420
This course will focus on the construction of object oriented software. Students will learn conceptual models for organizing objects and object hierarchies, an object oriented design notation and the application of design patterns. These capabilities will be used to solve relatively complex problems as a part of software development teams.



## Capstone Final Project
The final project was a semester-long iterative class-wide project to develop an application to maintain health information for clinics in rural Ghana. The class was broken up into five scrum teams to work on different parts of the application. Each team was required to communicate with other teams and push changes to the application with compatibility in mind.

The class was broken up into five scrum teams to work on different parts of the application: Antenatal, Immunization, Births and Deliveries, Consulting Register, and Family Planning. My group was the Antenatal team. 



## Assignment 1
We were instructed to create an application following the Model-View-Controller architecture.
We created a simple order entry system for a hypothetical nurseryt that sells flowering plants. In this system, customers call up and order a number of items from the list of available items. If an item does not exist in inventory then that particular item is not put on the order. Orders are sent out to the customers billing address.
The software system has a simple menu driven interface (Can be text based or a GUI) to complete a number of actions associated with managing customers, inventory, and orders. 
This assignment was a gatekeeper for the course.
