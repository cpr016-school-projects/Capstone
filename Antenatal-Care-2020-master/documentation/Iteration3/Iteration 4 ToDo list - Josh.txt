TO DO NEXT ITERATION

- Update Pregnancy so that getActive only returns first active (should only be)

- Possibly refactor out all wrapper classes
  - Determine which classes would work better as primatives
  - Determine which may need nullable values

- Refactor Visit controller
  - Rewrite newVisit method to be more useful

- Refactor VisitService
  - There should only ever be one active pregnancy. Returning a list causes a lot of problems

- Hide Patient information if no visit is found

- Clean up PatientView and set left hand side to constrain against middle of the window

- Figure out a better way to navigate tab panel in code. Currently doing weird math to navigate out of visit view

- Determine new layout/design for Visit view to account for prepopulated information
  - Redesign Visit view
  - Add more granular error checking for input

- Figure out ways to use JUnit to test front end

- Get Patient Info page to populate with new information after successfully saving a new visit
